## About

This repository is a one of my React web app portfolio. This web app is a e-commerce clothing store, and this is the tools I use to develop this app:

1. React Router
2. React Redux for state management
3. Firebase for user authentication
4. Firestore database for storing items data
5. Stripe API for processing payments
6. Deployment in Heroku
7. The app is also PWA (Progressive Web App) compliant
